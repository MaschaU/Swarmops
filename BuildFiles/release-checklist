TO TEST AND DO A SPRINT RELEASE
-------------------------------


Sprint build procedure
----------------------

git pull
git checkout sprint
git merge master
./prepare-sprint
git push

Wait for completion, then shell to swarmops-build
sudo ./do-swarmops-candidate

Reset machines swarmops-test-* to last snapshot
Update machines by distribution

If a while since last snapshot, take new snapshot



Actual test procedure
---------------------

Install mysql-server (this isn't installed already). There is some
previous data. Root db password on all test machines is "sandbox".

DEBIAN ONLY (which has disabled TCP root access to mariadb by default)
{
  mysql -u root -p
  GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES on *.* to 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'sandbox';
  FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
  exit
}

Install swarmops-frontend-rc, swarmops-backend-rc  (rc for release candidate)
Browse to test machines and run installation on each

Test is COMPLETE when dashboard is successfully presented and no UX glitches
were noticed



shell to swarmops-build to repackage exact same thing for release
sudo ./do-swarmops-sprint

Note the build number
