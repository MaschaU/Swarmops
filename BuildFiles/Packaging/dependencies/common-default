# refuses to run with all its components installed, but runs fine with
# the metapackage mono-devel installed

# Still including individual dependencies as detected earlier if I figure
# out exactly why mono-devel is required

# This file is a template included with dependencies for the swarmops-common package.
# It is included into the control file when packages are built. If there exists
# a file with the name common-[distro], it is selected for a distro, otherwise, 
# common-default is used.
#
# Note that all entries are preceded by a space. That's a requirement because
# of how control lines in the debian packages are folded to multiline, and
# this file is included in-situ into the control template.
#
# For the same reason, there can't be any non-comment empty lines,
# or any comment lines first in the file, before the first dependency.
