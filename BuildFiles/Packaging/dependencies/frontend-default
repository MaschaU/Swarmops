# This file is a template included with dependencies for the swarmops frontend.
# It is included into the control file when packages are built. If there exists
# a file with the name frontend-[distro], it is selected for a distro, otherwise, 
# front-default is used.
#
# Note that all entries are preceded by a space. That's a requirement because
# of how control lines in the debian packages are folded to multiline, and
# this file is included in-situ into the control template.
#
# For the same reason, there can't be any non-comment empty lines,
# or any comment lines first in the file, before the first dependency.
