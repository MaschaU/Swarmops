# Mono-devel is repeated here, it's in common as well. Some day we're going to have
# to figure out why the backend refuses to run with a System.Runtime assembly missing
# exception when mono-devel isn't present.
#
# For now, I have to admit it's a convenient cop-out to assure that all the common
# assemblies are in place.

# Inkscape, deliberately installed on the backend, is for conversion of generated
# SVG files to PDFs. There are other utilities and libraries that do this but none
# that do it as well and reliably.

# This file is a template included with dependencies for the swarmops backend.
# It is included into the control file when packages are built. If there exists
# a file with the name backend-[distro], it is selected for a distro, otherwise, 
# backend-default is used.
#
# Note that all entries are preceded by a space. That's a requirement because
# of how control lines in the debian packages are folded to multiline, and
# this file is included in-situ into the control template.
#
# For the same reason, there can't be any non-comment empty lines,
# or any comment lines first in the file, before the first dependency.
