# Mono-devel is repeated here, it's in common as well. Some day we're going to have

# assemblies are in place.

 mono-devel,

# Imagemagick is for backend conversion of PDFs to bitmaps.

# SVG files to PDFs. There are other utilities and libraries that do this but none
# that do it as well and reliably.
